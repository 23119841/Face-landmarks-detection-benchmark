# Face-landmarks-detection-benchmark
Face landmarks(fiducial points) detection evaluation.

Attention! It's comparision of specific implementations, not algorithms by itself, so if you know how to improve results let me know.

Metric: 
~~~
"The average point-to-point Euclidean error normalized by the inter-ocular distance (measured as the Euclidean distance between the outer corners of the eyes)"
http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/media/uploads/competitions/compute_error.m

"RMSE is very common and is a suitable general-purpose error metric. Compared to the Mean Absolute Error, RMSE punishes large errors"

Seems to be commercialized, closed source and not publicly available to download, not worth considering it:

Too simple algorithm, not worth considering it:
